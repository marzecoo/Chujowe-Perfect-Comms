# Changelog

## Perfect Comms v2.0.9

This Perfect Comms release lets you customize the speaking bar, cleans up the in-game UI and player icons, and makes voice more reliable and secure.

### What's Changed

- Added a Voice Falloff Softness slider so you can adjust how clearly you hear players while they're within your vision.
- Added sliders to move the speaking bar wherever you like on each card.
- Added a setting to switch the speaking bar between a horizontal or vertical layout, and player icons now stay neatly inside the card.
- Added a setting to let team radio be used during meetings.
- Added a setting to move the Jailor's unmute button, so now you can unmute the jailee from the meeting card and switch the button's position in the settings.
- Improved the in-game UI and player icons, so speaking indicators always show up correctly and an icon is never left invisible.
- Disguised players (camouflage, morph, and similar) now stay properly hidden on the speaking bar instead of giving away who they are.
- Voice now repairs itself when someone's connection drops, instead of everyone needing to refresh.
- Strengthened security so hackers can't tamper with host settings or pretend to be someone else.
- Improved audio so it sounds smoother, with fewer crackles and dropouts when a connection hiccups.
- Fixed voice in more situations like joining a lobby, exile, meetings, security cameras, and when players disconnect, so the right people can always hear each other.

See `docs/release-notes-v2.0.9.md` for the full release notes.

## Perfect Comms v2.0.8

This Perfect Comms release improves camera hearing, room-policy mutes, and boosted voice playback.

### What's Changed

- Fixed Airship camera hearing with real Airship camera positions.
- Added **Ghosts Also Meeting/Lobby Only** under **Meetings/Lobby Only**.
- Blocked disconnected, dummy, and invisible players from being routed through voice.
- Fixed speaker mute so volume refreshes and backend reconnects do not restore playback while deafened.
- Let player volume reach 200% while keeping boosted playback limited to avoid fuzzy output.

See `docs/release-notes-v2.0.8.md` for the full release notes.

## Perfect Comms v2.0.7

This Perfect Comms release fixes transitional voice routing around exile and other non-gameplay phases.

### What's Changed

- Changed Exile to use meeting-style voice routing instead of falling back to lobby proximity.
- Preserved meeting mutes during Exile, so blackmailed and jailed players stay muted through the exile sequence.
- Kept task-only role mutes out of lobby-like phases such as Intro, EndGame, Menu, and Unknown.
- Shared the same phase policy across BetterCrewLink and Interstellar so both backends route transitions consistently.

See `docs/release-notes-v2.0.7.md` for the full release notes.

## Perfect Comms v2.0.6

This Perfect Comms release expands role-aware voice behavior and adds team radio channels.

### What's Changed

- Added **Crewpostor: Use Impostor Voice**.
  - Crewpostor can use impostor radio, talk with impostors in vents, and inherit the other impostor-only voice behavior when this option is enabled.
- Added **Swooper: Mute While Swooped**.
- Added **Glitch: Mute Hacked Players**.
- Added **Medium: Ghost Voice**.
  - Choose **Medium -> Ghost**, **Ghost -> Medium**, or **Both** for private Medium spirit communication.
- Added **Eclipsal/Grenadier: Muffle Blinded/Flashed Hearing**.
- Added **Hypnotist: Muffle Hypnotized During Hysteria**.
- Changed **Impostor Radio** to **Team Radio** with:
  - **Team Radio - Impostors**
  - **Team Radio - Vampires**
  - **Team Radio - Lovers**
  - Players with more than one radio can cycle between channels with a keybind.
- Improved Role Voice Rules labels with role-first wording, role-matched colors thanks to @idkimneil in [#6](https://github.com/artriy/Perfect-Comms/pull/6), and cleaner ordering.

See `docs/release-notes-v2.0.6.md` for the full release notes.

## Perfect Comms v2.0.5

This Perfect Comms release adds role-based voice controls and improves voice button placement.

### What's Changed

- Added a new *Perfect Comms: Role Voice Rules* settings section for role-specific voice behavior.
- Added *Mute Blackmailed Next Round* so blackmail can optionally continue after the meeting.
- Added options to mute parasite-controlled and puppeteer-controlled players.
- Improved voice button placement so mic, speaker, and jail controls stay visible and easier to position near the screen edge.

See `docs/release-notes-v2.0.5.md` for the full release notes.

## Perfect Comms v2.0.4

This Perfect Comms release focuses on BetterCrewLink audio stability and chat input safety.

### Fixed

- Fixed intermittent fuzzy/static audio in BetterCrewLink lobbies when multiple voices overlap.
- Fixed hot BetterCrewLink mic frames after RNNoise so clipped capture peaks are limited before Opus encoding.
- Fixed chat input handling so Perfect Comms no longer intercepts textbox typing, preventing crashes while typing in chat.

See `docs/release-notes-v2.0.4.md` for the full release notes.

## Perfect Comms v2.0.3

This Perfect Comms release focuses on voice stability, speaking ring accuracy, noise suppression, and cleaner in-game controls.

### What's Changed

- Added volume controls sliders by @idkimneil in [#4](https://github.com/artriy/Perfect-Comms/pull/4).
- Reduced mute/unmute spam crashes with serialized mic capture transitions.
- Added RNNoise noise suppression, enabled by default.
- Added host and local voice refresh keybinds.
- Added MB4/MB5 mouse button bind support (in local settings).
- Fixed comms sabotage voice blocking detection.
- Fixed rainbow, idle-pose, and morph/mimic speaking ring portraits.
- Added Middle Left and Middle Right speaking bar positions.
- Improved voice overlay positioning, layout, scale, and defaults.
- Improved the player volume menu and slider behavior.
- Deafened players now stop transmitting voice too.
- Removed `.DS_Store`.

See `docs/release-notes-v2.0.3.md` for the full release notes.

## Perfect Comms v2.0.2

### What's Changed

- Fixed voice keybind behavior while chat is open so toggle shortcuts stay blocked during typing, while push-to-talk and impostor radio can still activate after a short hold.
- Fixed printable push-to-talk and radio keys in chat so quick taps type normally, but held voice keys do not spam characters into the message field.
- Fixed push-to-talk chat handling so it only applies when Mic Mode is set to Push To Talk.
- Fixed impostor radio chat handling so it only applies when the local player can actually use the radio, including blackmailer and jailor voice-block rules.
- Changed Push To Talk mode so the mute toggle no longer creates a redundant manual mute state; released PTT remains muted and holding PTT still transmits.
- Fixed the `VC: mic unavailable` warning appearing during normal Push To Talk idle mute.

See `docs/release-notes-v2.0.2.md` for the full release notes.

## Perfect Comms v2.0.1

### What's Changed

- Changed the assets to a cleaner version by @AtonyGit in #1.
- Fixed the Voice Lobbies close X so it sits in a clearer top-right position and is easier to see.
- Fixed bottom-positioned speaking indicators so player names no longer clip off the bottom of the screen while staying close to the edge.

See `docs/release-notes-v2.0.1.md` for the full release notes.

## Perfect Comms v2.0.0

This is the backend rewrite release. Perfect Comms no longer depends on Among Us RPCs for voice audio transport. Voice now runs through selectable voice backends, with BetterCrewLink live voice as the default path and Interstellar available as an alternate backend.

### Most Notable Changes

- BetterCrewLink backend + lobby browser is now fully built in.
- Interstellar backend is now fully supported.
- Voice transport no longer depends on Among Us RPCs.
- Public lobby browsing and publishing are much better.
- Directional and proximity audio are more reliable.
- Host settings now sync across the lobby automatically.
- Debug logs are quiet by default unless you turn them on.

See `docs/release-notes-v2.0.0.md` for the full technical changelog.

## Perfect Comms v1.0.2

### Changed

- Reposition Perfect Comms as its own Among Us proximity chat mod.
- Document TOU-Mira as a supported mod behaviour instead of a requirement.
- Add `PerfectComms+dependencies.zip` with BepInEx, MiraAPI, Reactor, and Perfect Comms.
- Cache supported-mod role state for 0.25 seconds instead of checking every voice snapshot.

### Fixed

- Missing TOU-Mira role/modifier types now no-op and retry instead of being cached as unavailable.
- Default voice lobby title now uses `Perfect Comms` instead of TOU-Mira-specific wording.

## Perfect Comms v1.0.1

### Changed

- Update notifications now check GitHub releases directly for future releases.

### Fixed

- Speaking indicators now render above the Among Us game UI instead of being hidden behind menus or scene elements.
- Speaking-ring player icons now show a stable recolored crewmate body with loaded cosmetics, without cloning live player objects.

## Perfect Comms v1.0.0

**PUBLIC BETA — expect bugs.**  
This is the first public Perfect Comms release. It is ready for real lobbies, but still needs wider testing.

### What makes this release special

- **Fully integrated proximity chat** — voice runs inside Among Us, no separate voice app needed.
- **Supported mod behaviours** — TOU-Mira blackmailed players stay muted, and Jailor can unmute jailed players.
- **No more hackers messing with the voice** — voice stays tied to compatible Perfect Comms clients.
- **Built-in Voice Lobbies** — find compatible voice lobbies from the main menu and join with one click.
- **In-game update prompt** — players can be sent straight to the newest release when an update drops.

### Added

- Native Perfect Comms BepInEx plugin.
- Windows release build: `PerfectComms.dll`.
- Android release build: `PerfectCommsAndroid.dll`.
- Dependency bundle: `PerfectComms+dependencies.zip` with BepInEx, MiraAPI, Reactor, and Perfect Comms.
- Proximity voice during gameplay.
- Meeting voice behavior for modded role states.
- Jailor-controlled jailed voice support.
- Blackmailer voice blocking support.
- Voice Lobby button and lobby browser.
- Compatible-client voice checks.
- Reactor mod list entry for Perfect Comms.
- Clickable main-menu update notification.

### Beta notes

- **Expect bugs in some lobbies.** Report anything weird to me.
- 15-player support is designed and hardened, but still needs more real public-lobby testing.
- Everyone in the lobby should use the same Perfect Comms release.
