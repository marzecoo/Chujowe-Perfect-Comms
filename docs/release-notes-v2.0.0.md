## Perfect Comms v2.0.0

This is the biggest Perfect Comms update so far.

Voice no longer rides on Among Us RPCs. Perfect Comms now uses real voice backends, with BetterCrewLink live voice as the main path and Interstellar as an alternate backend. The result is better voice reliability, better lobby support, cleaner directional audio, and much stronger host-synced room behavior.

### Most Notable Changes

- BetterCrewLink backend + lobby browser is now fully built in.
- Interstellar backend is now fully supported.
- Voice transport no longer depends on Among Us RPCs.
- Public lobby browsing and publishing are much better.
- Directional and proximity audio are more reliable.
- Host settings now sync across the lobby automatically.
- Debug logs are quiet by default unless you turn them on.
